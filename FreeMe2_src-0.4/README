Currently FreeMe2 support three options: v,s and 2. Any combination of those is valid.
v - verbose mode
s - ask for SID
2 - use FreeMe2 orignal decryption engine (by default we use MPlayers one).

Example configurations:
Decrypt file;
./FreeMe2 some_file
Decrypt file in verbose mode;
./FreeMe2 -v some_file
Decrypt file but force program to ask for sid;
./FreeMe2 -s some_file
Decrypt file but force program to ask for sid in verbose mode;
./FreeMe2 -vs some_file
Decrypt file but force program to ask for sid in verbose mode using FreeMe2 decryption engine.
./FreeMe2 -vs2 some_file
